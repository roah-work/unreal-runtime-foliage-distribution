Unreal Engine Runtime Foliage Scatter Plugin
A simple Unreal Engine plugin to procedurally scatter Static Mesh foliage instances (bushes and trees) at runtime or in editor using Hierarchical Instanced Static Meshes (HISM), with optional heightfield and mask textures.

Overview
This plugin provides an actor ARR_FoliageScatter that:

Distributes mesh instances across a flat PlaneBoundsMesh scaled by SpawnScale

Supports two categories: bushes (Category = 1) and trees (Category â‰  1)

Prevents overlap between assets based on radii (Radius_1, Radius_2) plus interFoliage_dist

Computes height from a grayscale HeightfieldTexture, scaled and offset using Landscape_Z_Scale and Landscape_Z_Offset

Optionally masks placement using a binary FoliageTexture: only pixels with full white (value = 1.0) pass

Builds a spatial grid (GridMap) for efficient neighbor checking

Executes on editor OnConstruction or via a CallInEditor button when RunCustomConstructionScript is enabled

Structures & Components
F_RR_FoliageAssets
Defines each foliage type:

UStaticMesh* FoliageMesh

Category (int)

Radius_1, Radius_2 (float collision radii)

Default FTransform

F_RR_TransformsArray
Holder for TArray<FTransform> transforms

Configuration Properties (Editor-Exposed)
RunCustomConstructionScript (bool): trigger generation manually

SpawnScale (float): size multiplier of plane mesh (minimum 10)

numIterations (int): number of random placement attempts

interFoliage_dist (float): additional minimum separation

Seed (int) / RandomSeed (bool): reproducible vs random seed

Cell_Size, Grid_Size: grid parameters for spatial hashing

HeightfieldTexture, FoliageTexture (UTexture2D*): placement rules

Workflow
In Construction (or via Regenerate()), if enabled:

Adjust plane size based on SpawnScale

Reinitialize seed

Compute spawn bounds from plane

Build GridMap

Loop numIterations:

Choose a random asset and transform (position, rotation, scale)

Check no overlap in current cell and neighbors

Add transform to appropriate array (BushTransforms or TreeTransforms)

Apply heightfield via PopulateZFromTexture

If mask enabled: filter transforms via maskFoliageWithTexture

Call SpawnInstances() to add on HISM components

Supports large instance counts efficiently using HISM and cell-based spatial partitioning.

Installation & Usage
Clone or copy into your Unreal Project:
Place plugin folder under Plugins/RuntimeFoliageScatter/Source/...

Compile plugin (Visual Studio or Unreal Build Tool).

In Unreal Editor:

Drag ARR_FoliageScatter into your level

Configure properties in the Details panel:

Add entries to Source Foliage Assets (mesh, radii, category)

Set SpawnScale, numIterations, and interFoliage_dist

Assign HeightfieldTexture and optionally FoliageTexture

Set Seed or enable RandomSeed

Enable RunCustomConstructionScript, press Regenerate

The actor will scatter foliage in editor immediately and display the result.

Notes & Recommendations
Ensure Source_FoliageAssets entries have correct radii values

Default mesh scale, grid size, and iteration count should balance density vs performance

Heightfield texture expects 16-bit grayscale packed in R and G channels: high-value pixels map to higher Z offset

Mask textures use binary filter: only fully white pixels (mapped z == 1.0) allow placement

Cell_Size should reflect average spatial separation to optimize neighbor search

Extension Ideas
Possible future expansions:

Support varied mesh scales per asset

Different exclusion rules per asset type

Non-planar bounds (e.g., landscape sampling)

GPU-accelerated placement
